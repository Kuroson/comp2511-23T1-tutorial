# COMP2511 23T1 Tutorial

## How to use this

- To find the code written in your tutorial, change the branch on GitHub to your **class's code**. ([W13B](https://github.com/Kuroson/comp2511-23T1-tutorial/tree/W13B) [F11A](https://github.com/Kuroson/comp2511-23T1-tutorial/tree/F11A))
- To find my generic solutions (that may differ to your class's solutions), change the branch to `solutions`. ([solutions](https://github.com/Kuroson/comp2511-23T1-tutorial/tree/solutions))
- PDF versions of the slides should be located in the `slides` branch ([slides](https://github.com/Kuroson/comp2511-23T1-tutorial/tree/slides)). If I have forgotten to upload them, please let me know via email.
- If you're desperate for the PDF slides, you can use my last term's slides [here](https://github.com/Kuroson/comp2511-T13B-22T3/tree/master/slides).
- Slides are found here [https://slides.com/kuroson](https://slides.com/kuroson).
